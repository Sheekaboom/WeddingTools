These will be my private vows Rebecca and I exchange during our first look

# Notes

- First time I saw you in the quad

- Love for space

- Stick with me through it all
  - my cray adventures
  - my attempt to die from the common cold
  - my apparent obsession with going to school

- You are beautiful, intelligent and kind. I love your awe and respect for nature and you're excitement for travel and adventure.

- I promise to always wear the clothes you buy for me and listen when you correct my english.

- I love when you take the covers at night, even if its only because it forces cuddling ;)

- I'm so excited for what our future holds, wherever we deceide to live, and for whatever kind of family we decide to have.
	I'm really just excited to go through all of it with you by my side.

- Whether it's going on a dive trip or sitting on the back deck with some wine and watching the sunset, I want to do it all with you. I want to spend every gossiping about my crazy ass family and listening to you talk about soccer, although I cannot promise I know what or who you're talking about.

- Even though our friends may come and go, it will always be me and you, side by side, having adventures and experiencing life, for the rest of our lives, and I cannot wait.

# Vows
Rebecca, ever since the first time I saw you in the engineering quad I've wanted to be by your side. What started with a crush quickly turned into wanting to spend every waking moment by your side. Whether it was frisbee or just sitting and watching TV in a dorm room, I wanted to be nowhere else but with you.

In these past nine years you have stuck with me through it all; My crazy adventures, my attempt to die from the common cold, and even my apparent obsession with going to school. I promise to do the same and always be by your side through both the good and the bad.

Alright, I understand this isn't the best transition but as you know this is how my brain tends to work and I'm not the best with words so stick with me...

I love when you take the covers at night, even if it's just because it forces you to cuddle ;)
I love our date nights with steaks, a loaf of bread and dipping butter.
I want to spend every day gossiping about my crazy ass family and listening to you talk about soccer, although I cannot promise I know what or who you're talking about. 
Whether it's going on a dive trip to some foreign country or sitting on the back deck with some wine and watching the sunset, I want to do it all with you. 

I'm excited for what our future holds, wherever we decide to live, and for whatever kind of family we decide to have. I'm really just excited to spend it with you.

Even though our friends may come and go, I'm happy it will always be me and you, side by side, having adventures and experiencing life, for the rest of our lives. I really cannot wait.
